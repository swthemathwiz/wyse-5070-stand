# wyse-5070-stand
This is a 3D-Printable Openscad model of a stand for the Dell Wyse 5070 Thin Client using
the existing mounts in the case.

There are 3 different variations: minimal, large, and mesh. The
minimal fits is about the width of a slim 5070 with 4 wings and works well for the slim 5070. 
The large version is very close in shape and style to the OEM stand. The mesh version 
is like the large except that it has a mesh inset that looks like the 5070's textured surface.
